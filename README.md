## OpenXMB

OpenXMB is an open source implementation of Sony's XMB used in the PS3, PSP, PSX and some Bravia televisions.

**What am I able to do with it?**

OpenXMB will be an API of sorts which will make producing clean user interfaces much easier.

**What is it written in?**

It is written in C and OpenGL Embedded Standard so porting to other platforms shouldn't be that hard.

**On what platforms does it work?**

The primary goal is to run it in PS4 hardware, but later on operating systems like Linux, MacOS, Windows should be able to support it.
